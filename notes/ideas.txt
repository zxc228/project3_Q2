Research ideas:
    - Look into ways of hosting this server
    - Experiment with prompts => what problems can be somewhat reliably be solved using llms?

TODO: 
    - FINISH THE TODOs IN THE CODE
    - Make emails have visually appealling -> stylise / customise emails

what data is of interest? 
    - Current uni degree + mention
    - CVs (diverse data about education, skills, interest, employment)
    - University grades -> most ppl dont like their grades being snooped
    - Portfolio website containing CV / showcasing personal projects
    - area/field of interest, companies of interest (if they want to go to a specific company)

Because a potential employer will then look into that applicant's expertise, and may or may not be interest in the applicant
what is important is steering applicants in the right directions, based on their interests and strengths, not their grades ... but whatever
